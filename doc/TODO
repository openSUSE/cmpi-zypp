- find one CIM_ComputerSystem for associations of SUSE_InstalledSoftwareIdentity
  and SUSE_HostedCollection. Don't know if it is possible that there are more
  then one modeled inside of one namespace. 
  Maybe search for it in every constructor of a provider and store it in 
  a global variable. We need to store the two keys CreationClassName and Name

- find a way to provide a filter object to the common assoc_* functions.

- is it possible to release the zypp lock after exit of a provider function?
  If a new zyppacc object is created, will the lock automatically enabled again?
